# My Personal Project

## Personal Planner App


This is a personal planner app that manages *all* kinds of different 
tasks by categorizing them according to their corresponding due dates and/or tags.
To help notify the user of his/her daily tasks, the app gives **daily reminders** of what 
is due at the end of the day. 
This app is perfect for:
- Scheduling homework and studies
- Organizing workout and training routines
- Outlining daily tasks
- Planning a vacation!
- Checking the weather
- Reading Top News Headlines

Basically, anybody can find this To-Do app helpful. I am interested in this project
because I have always wanted my UBC canvas calendar to have more functionalities. I like how the way 
its due dates are color coded based on the course, however, it would be nice if it can be customized to fulfill
personal accommodations. As an example, I have a habit of going to the math centre on Tuesdays, and I would like
to have that on my calendar in addition to some other tasks.
